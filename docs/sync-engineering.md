# Cloud Sync — Engineering

This is the engineering reference for the cloud-sync subsystem. The big-picture
design and rationale live in [`docs/plans/cloud-sync.md`](plans/cloud-sync.md);
this doc captures the contracts and operational details that current code
relies on so that future contributors don't reinvent them.

The subsystem ships in eight phases (see the design doc). **Today, only Phase
1 is in-tree** — UUID columns, canonical JSON, and a manual export/import
workflow. Sections in this doc that pertain to Phase 2+ are marked
*Forward-looking* and describe the contract those phases are expected to land
against, not anything that runs yet.

## Architecture overview

The eventual delivery mechanism is a per-project GitHub repo — each install
keeps a working tree under `appDataDir()/sync/{projectUuid}/repo/`, pushes and
pulls via JGit, and resolves conflicts in the UI. Phase 1 is the file format
that those phases will commit, fetched from disk via local export/import
buttons rather than git.

The repo split is:

* **Portable** (synced, lives in JSON): show content — cues, presets, fixture
  patches, scripts, etc.
* **Machine-local** (never synced): controller IPs and similar per-rig
  configuration. Phase 1 handles this for `DaoUniverseConfigs.address` by
  stripping the field at export time. Phase 2 introduces a generic
  `machine_override` table.
* **Transient runtime state** (never synced): grand master / blackout state,
  AI conversation history, parked DMX channels.

## Repo layout (Phase 1)

Phase 1 ships a flatter layout than the eventual git-repo layout. Everything
lives directly under the export folder:

```
formatVersion.json
project.json
installs.json                  # empty in Phase 1; Phase 2 populates
showEntries/{uuid}.json
cueStacks/{uuid}.json
cues/{uuid}.json               # carries cueStackUuid (nullable)
cuePropertyAssignments/{uuid}.json   # carries cueUuid
cuePresetApplications/{uuid}.json    # carries cueUuid + presetUuid
cueAdHocEffects/{uuid}.json    # carries cueUuid
cueTriggers/{uuid}.json        # carries cueUuid + scriptUuid
fixturePatches/{uuid}.json     # carries universeConfigUuid
universeConfigs/{uuid}.json    # `address` deliberately omitted (machine-local)
fixtureGroups/{uuid}.json      # members embedded inline
fxPresets/{uuid}.json          # propertyAssignments embedded inline
fxDefinitions/{uuid}.json
cueSlots/{uuid}.json
controlSurfaceBindings/{uuid}.json
scripts/{uuid}.kts             # raw Kotlin script body for git-friendly diffs
scripts/{uuid}.meta.json       # metadata sidecar (name, scriptType)
```

A future phase may re-nest cue children under their parent stack folder
(`cueStacks/{stackUuid}/cues/{cueUuid}/...`) so `git diff` scopes to the
edited stack — that's a `formatVersion` bump when it lands.

## Canonical JSON contract

Round-trip stability is a correctness concern, not a stylistic one. Two
exports of semantically identical state must produce byte-identical files;
otherwise every commit is dominated by incidental key reorderings, breaking
diff readability and making three-way merge useless.

The contract is implemented in
[`sync/CanonicalJson.kt`](../src/main/kotlin/uk/me/cormack/lighting7/sync/CanonicalJson.kt):

* **`prettyPrint = true`, 2-space indent** — diffs are human-readable.
* **`explicitNulls = false`** — null fields are omitted. Adding a new optional
  field is therefore forward-compatible: existing repos serialise without it,
  older readers skip it (`ignoreUnknownKeys = true`).
* **`encodeDefaults = false`** — fields equal to their default are omitted.
  Combined with the previous setting, a fresh DTO with default state encodes
  to `{}`.
* **Recursive key sort** — kotlinx.serialization's `JsonObject` is a
  `LinkedHashMap` that preserves insertion order, which depends on
  `@Serializable` property declaration order. We re-walk the encoded
  `JsonElement` and sort keys alphabetically before stringifying. Without this
  step, a property reorder in source code produces noisy diffs.
* **Trailing newline** — POSIX-friendly; also avoids the "no newline at end
  of file" diff marker.

Anything that round-trips through the sync layer must use `canonicalEncode()`,
not a raw `Json.encodeToString`.

## UUID contract

Every synced DAO carries a `uuid: UUID` column. JSON foreign keys are by UUID
(e.g. `cueStackUuid`, `presetUuid`); int ids are local-only handles that
never appear in exported files.

The DAO declaration is:

```kotlin
val uuid = uuid("uuid").autoGenerate()
```

`autoGenerate()` ensures every new row gets a UUID. UUID-collision protection
on import is enforced at the application layer in `ProjectImporter` (a
fast `find { uuid eq targetUuid }` lookup before insert), not via a unique
index — random UUIDs make accidental collisions astronomically unlikely.

New tables default to **not synced** until explicitly added to
`ProjectExporter` / `ProjectImporter`. Don't rely on auto-discovery.

## Ordinal contract (forward-looking)

Phase 1 keeps `sortOrder: Int` on the ten ordered tables. Phase 5 replaces
this with `ordinal: Double` so concurrent multi-master inserts can pick
midpoints without cascading renumbers; tiebreak by UUID for determinism.
That's a `formatVersion` bump and a migration. Today, exports already sort
embedded child arrays by `(sortOrder, uuid)` so the canonical output is
deterministic ahead of the type change.

## Format versioning

`formatVersion.json` at repo root carries `{ formatVersion, minReader }`.
Phase 1 writes `1` for both. Rules for future phases:

* New optional field → no version bump (`ignoreUnknownKeys = true`).
* New required field, removed field, or semantic change → bump
  `formatVersion`.
* Truly breaking change → bump both `formatVersion` and `minReader`.

On import, an export with `formatVersion > 1` is rejected (HTTP 422). When
Phase 5+ migrations land, they live at
`sync/migrations/V{n}_to_V{n+1}.kt` and run before the importer's
three-way diff.

## Machine-local data

Phase 1 strips `DaoUniverseConfigs.address` from the export DTO — the field
is the controller IP, which is per-rig. On import, `address` is left null;
the operator restores it via the existing universe-configs UI (or, from
Phase 2, via the generic `machine_override` table).

This is the precedent for any future per-install field. The decision tree
in `CLAUDE.md` §"Database changes and cloud sync" guides which side of the
portable/machine-local line a new field falls on.

## Project import semantics

The Phase 1 importer is intentionally restrictive — it's the manual-backup
case, not multi-master sync. Import:

1. Validates `formatVersion ≤ 1` (422 otherwise).
2. Refuses (409) if a project with the imported UUID already exists. The
   operator can delete that project or skip the import; merge is Phase 5+.
3. Refuses (409) if the imported name collides with an existing project's
   name (unique index). The operator supplies a `nameOverride` to
   disambiguate.
4. Forces `isCurrent = false` and `activeEntryId = null` on insert. The
   operator switches to the imported project explicitly via the existing
   "Activate" UI.
5. Resolves UUID-keyed FKs in topological order: `projects → scripts →
   fxDefinitions → fxPresets → … → cues → cue-children → showEntries →
   cueSlots → controlSurfaceBindings`.
6. Wraps the whole sequence in a single
   `transaction(state.database) { … }` — any FK or validation failure
   rolls back atomically.

## Sync session lifecycle (forward-looking)

Phase 3+ introduces a `sync_session` row that survives a crash mid-sync. The
state machine is `FETCHING → CONFLICTS_PENDING → APPLYING → DONE/FAILED`.
Phase 1 has no equivalent because there's no remote — export/import are
single shots that either succeed or roll back, no resumable state.

## Operational notes

* **Default export path**: `appDataDir().resolve("exports").resolve(projectUuid)`
  (`~/Library/Application Support/lighting7/exports/{projectUuid}/` on macOS).
  Caller-supplied paths are honoured verbatim.
* **DB**: SQLite on the lighting7 install path.
* **Tests**: `src/test/kotlin/uk/me/cormack/lighting7/sync/` covers
  canonical-JSON determinism, round-trip byte-identity, UUID-collision /
  name-collision refusal, FK-resolution failure rollback, machine-local
  field stripping, and `isCurrent` reset.

## How to add a new synced field (Phase 1)

1. Add the column to the relevant DAO file.
2. Decide portable vs. machine-local using the CLAUDE.md decision tree.
3. **Portable**: add the field to the matching DTO in `sync/dto/SyncDtos.kt`,
   pass it through `ProjectExporter` and `ProjectImporter`, and extend the
   round-trip test to assert it survives.
4. **Machine-local**: don't touch the sync DTO. From Phase 2, add it to
   `machine_override` instead.
5. If the change isn't covered by `explicitNulls = false` /
   `encodeDefaults = false` (i.e. it's a required field with no default),
   that's a `formatVersion` bump — see "Format versioning".
